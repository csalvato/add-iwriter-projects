# Automated iWriter Project Entry

A simple script to read a CSV that contains descriptions of iWriter projects and automatically enter them into iWriter.


The script first reads the CSV file, and with each entry from the CSV, it creates the XML format that needs to be sent to iWriter to create the project.

With this script, once can quickly create hundreds of iWriter article requests within minutes.

This script was originally used to request the writing of hundreds of articles for a Private Blog Network used for various web properties.
